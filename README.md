### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

They did it gave me a good indirect example on how to set up my back end. I felt not as confident connecting front end to back end but there was one slide I missed that guided you on how to start.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would've made the site look better and also implement a sign-in feature to better organize the orders.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I have't done it yet but I think it will go well seeing as how it is complete and works consistently.
